                <p> Neodymium was first discovered in 1885 by Carl Auer von Welsbach, an Austrian chemist who studied rare earth elements for much of his life. Prior to the work of von Welsbach, rare earth elements were often found together in minerals and were difficult to separate leaving many to believe that it was its own element, didymium. Welsbach succeeded in isolating neodymium as a distinct element from didymium, becoming the first to do so. After its discovery, scientists conducted extensive studies to characterize neodymium's properties the likes of which included determining its atomic structure, physical and chemical properties, and its place within the periodic table. Neodymium was found to belong to the lanthanide series, a group of elements characterized by their high melting and boiling points.</p>

                <p>Neodymium is a silvery-white metal with a bright luster. It is one of the lanthanide series of elements and is relatively soft and malleable. 
                    Neodymium has a melting point of 1297°C and a boiling point of 3347°C. Neodymium is a reactive element, tarnishing in air and reacting slowly with water. 
                    It forms various compounds, including neodymium oxide and neodymium chloride, which exhibit different properties and applications.
                    <br><br>The name "neodymium" is derived from the Greek words "neos," meaning new, and "didymos," meaning twin, referring to the element's separation from didymium.
