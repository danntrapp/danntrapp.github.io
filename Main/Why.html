                <p>Why would you choose neodymium for this project? I mean it's buried deep in the periodic table, rarely sees the light of day, and is little known by the masses yet has a certain charm. Its use in Maglev trains fascinates me and innovations such as this are truly amazing as you have to be a special kind of crazy to think of this. Other than its use in trains, neodymium surrounds me in my everyday life, whether it be the welding helmet I wear in robotics class, the electric motors used on the robotics team's robot, or the hard drive in my laptop. The strongest permanent magnets have found their way into every aspect of my life and I can't help but love it.</p>
